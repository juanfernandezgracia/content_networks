# Curricular content networks

This repository contains the code for reproducing the results of the paper "Complex networks approach to curriculum analysis and subject integration: a case study on Physics and Mathematics" by Paula Tuzón Marco, Antoni Salvà Salvà, and Juan Fernández-Gracia.

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15929)

The paper explores a complex networks approach to curriculum analysis and subject integration, focusing on the fields of Physics and Mathematics. The code provided in this repository allows for the replication of the study's results.

## Files

- `code_content_networks.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for constructing and analysing the curriculum content networks.
- `network_data.csv`: CSV file containing the data about the content networks.
- `*.pdf`, `*.png`: figures for the centralities
- `*.txt`: Spearman correlation coefficients among the centrality rankings.
- `*.tex`: Tables with the top ten contents in terms of centrality.

Please refer to the paper for a detailed explanation of the methodology and findings.
